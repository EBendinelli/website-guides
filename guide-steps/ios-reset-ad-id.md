Reset your Advertising Identifier on iOS

# Summary #
When your iOS device collects data such as what apps you looked at in the App Store, what places you spend the most time
at, or what news sources you typically read, this data is associated with a unique identifier, called the *Advertising
Identifier* (Ad ID) before it is sent to advertisers. The Ad ID is thus the only way for advertisers to identify your
device. In this guide you'll learn how to reset the Ad ID on your iOS device so that advertisers forget about your
previous activity, habits, and preferences.

### Reset your Ad ID ###
To reset your Ad ID on iOS, open the **Settings** application and then navigate to **Privacy > Advertising** and then
click on **Reset Advertising Identifier** (Fig. 1).

### Opt out of targeted advertising ###
To prevent that data collected from your device reaches advertisers and trackers, you can opt out of *Targeted
Advertisements*. Targeted advertisements are served to you based on multiple data points such as your location history,
your name and address, the music you listen to, or how many levels you've completed on your favourite game, which poses
a serious privacy risk.

To opt out of targeted ads based on location, open the **Settings** app and go to **Privacy > Location Services > System
Services** and turn off **Location-Based Apple Ads** (Fig. 2). To opt out of targeted ads from any other data points,
open the **Settings** app and go to **Privacy > Advertising** and turn on **Limit Ad Tracking** (Fig. 3).
