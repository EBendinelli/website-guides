Opt out of targeted ads and renew your Ad ID on iOS

# Summary #
Advertisers need to uniquely identify you across apps and websites in order to aggregate data they might collect about
you. To do so, Apple issues an Ad ID for your device, which it then shares with advertisers so they can serve you ads
based on your data. In this guide you'll learn how to avoid targeted advertisement either by periodically resetting your
Ad ID or by opting out completely.

### Opt out of targeted advertising ###
To prevent that data collected from your device reaches advertisers and trackers, you can opt out of targeted
advertisements. Targeted advertisements pose a serious privacy risk since they are served to you based on data points
such as your location history, your name and address, the music you listen to, or how many levels you've completed in
your favourite game.

To opt out of targeted ads based on location, open the **Settings** app and go to **Privacy > Location Services > System
Services** and turn off **Location-Based Apple Ads** (Fig. 2). To opt out of targeted ads from any other data points,
open the **Settings** app and go to **Privacy > Advertising** and turn on **Limit Ad Tracking** (Fig. 3).

### Renew your Ad ID ###
To renew your Ad ID on iOS, open the **Settings** application, navigate to **Privacy > Advertising** and then
click on **Reset Advertising Identifier** (Fig. 1).
