Opt out of targeted ads on macOS

# Summary #
Advertisers need to uniquely identify you across apps and websites in order to
aggregate data they might collect about you. To do so, Apple issues an Ad ID for
your device, which it then shares with advertisers so they can serve you ads
based on your data. In this guide you'll learn how to avoid targeted
advertisement on macOS either by periodically resetting your Ad ID or by opting
out completely.

**System Preferences** app, go to the **Security & Privacy** page, and then
click on the **Privacy** tab (Fig. 1).

On the privacy menu (Fig. 1), select **Analytics**, and then disable **Share Mac
Analytics** (Fig. 4) to prevent that diagnostic messages shared with Apple leak
your location data.
