Upon successful installation a notification appears on the top-right corner, and the uBlock Origin icon is added to the extension menu on your toolbar (Fig. 3). To pin the icon on the toolbar, click the extension menu, and then click the pin next to the uBlock Origin icon. When you visit a website, uBlock Origin automatically blocks malicious trackers and ads, which you can check by clicking the icon (Fig. 4).
