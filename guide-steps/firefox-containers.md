Isolating your online activity - Firefox Multi-Account Containers

# Summary #
One way to minimize tracking and improve your online privacy is to store as few browsing cookies as possible on your
device. However, in websites such as your email client or your note-taking web application, it's practical to have
cookies stored so that you don't have to login each time you visit. In this guide you'll learn how to install and setup
Firefox Multi-Account Containers to keep parts of your online activity isolated from each other, thus reducing your
digital footprint.

### Installation ###

Like any other add-on, install Firefox Multi-Account Containers by visiting the [Mozilla Firefox Add-ons
page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) and clicking **Add to Firefox** (Fig. 1)
and then clicking on **Add** when prompted (Fig. 2).

Upon successful installation a notification appears on the top-right corner, and the Firefox Multi-Account Containers
icon is added to your toolbar (Fig. 3). The first time you click the icon you are presented with a guide to better
understand how the add-on works (Fig. 4).

### Setup a container ###

You can create a container for any website. In this section, you'll learn how to setup a container for Twitter, but the
steps are similar for other websites. First, create the container by clicking the icon and then go to **Manage
containers > New container**. Enter the name for your container and press OK (Fig. 5).

Now, navigate to the Twitter website, click on the toolbar icon, and then click **Always Open This Site in...** and
select the container you just created (Fig. 6).

After you do so, Twitter links will open in its container, which you can check by the underlined tab and the symbol in
the address bar (Fig. 7).

When you are browsing in another container and navigate to a Twitter link, you'll be
automatically placed in the Twitter container. The first time this happens, you'll be asked if you want to open the link
in the designated container (Fig. 8). To do so automatically from now on, tick the **Remember my decision for this
site** box, and then click on **Open in Twitter Container**.
