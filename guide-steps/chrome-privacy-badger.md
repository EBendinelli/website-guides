Install an ad-blocker on Chrome - Privacy Badger

# Summary #

Online tracking and advertisement services are a severe threat for your online
privacy, since they follow you everywhere and collect as much data as they can,
over which you have no control. As such, when browsing the web, it is critical
to block these services from communicating with our browser. Privacy Badger is a
browser add-on to block ads and trackers from tracking you, by learning about
their behavior in real time: if an advertiser seems to be tracking your
browsing, Privacy Badger blocks it. As such, it works well alongside uBlock
Origin, which keeps a manually curated list on malicious services. Privacy
Badger is a project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and has a strong
[privacy policy](https://www.eff.org/code/privacy/policy).

In this guide, you'll learn how to install Privacy Badger on Chrome to block
malicious ads and trackers.

### Installation ###
 
 Like any other add-on, install Privacy Badger by visiting the [Mozilla Chrome
Add-ons page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp) and clicking **Add to Chrome** (Fig. 1) and then clicking on **Add** when
prompted (Fig. 2).

Upon successful installation, a notification page opens on your browser and
the Privacy Badger icon is added to the extension menu on your toolbar (Fig. 3).
To pin the icon on the toolbar, click the extension menu, and then click the pin
next to the Privacy Badger icon. When you visit a website, Privacy Badger
automatically blocks malicious trackers and ads, and sets a privacy protection
level (green, yellow, or red) which you can manually adjust by clicking the
toolbar icon (Fig. 4). To learn more about how Privacy Badger works, click the
icon and then click **Learn how Privacy Badger protects your privacy** (Fig. 5), or
visit its [official documentation](https://privacybadger.org/).
