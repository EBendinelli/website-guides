# Title  #
Install an ad-blocker on Chrome - Privacy Badger

# Summary #
Privacy Badger is a browser add-on to block ads and trackers from tracking you.
It keeps an up-to-date list of known trackers that it finds through automated
tests, and regularly pushes the updated list to your browser. As such, it works
well alongside uBlock Origin, which keeps a manually curated list on malicious
services. Privacy Badger is a project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and
has a strong [privacy policy][1].

In this guide, you'll learn how to install Privacy Badger on Chrome to block
malicious ads and trackers.

### Installation ###

 Like any other add-on, install Privacy Badger by visiting the [Chrome Web Store][2]
and clicking **Add to Chrome** (Fig. 1) and then clicking on **Add** when
prompted (Fig. 2).

Upon successful installation, a notification page opens on your browser and the
Privacy Badger icon is added to the extension menu on your toolbar (Fig. 3). To
pin the icon on the toolbar, click the extension menu, and then click the pin
next to the Privacy Badger icon. When you visit a website, Privacy Badger
automatically blocks malicious trackers and ads, and sets a privacy protection
level (green, yellow, or red) which you can manually adjust by clicking the
toolbar icon (Fig. 4). To learn more about how Privacy Badger works, click the
icon and then click **Learn how Privacy Badger protects your privacy** (Fig. 5),
or visit its [official documentation][3].
