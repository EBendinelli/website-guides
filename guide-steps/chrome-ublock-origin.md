Upon successful installation a notification appears on the top-right corner, and the uBlock Origin icon is added to the
extension menu on your toolbar (Fig. 3). To pin the icon on the toolbar, click the extension menu, and then click the
pin next to the uBlock Origin icon. When you visit a website, uBlock Origin automatically blocks malicious trackers and
ads, which you can check by clicking the icon (Fig. 4).
