Opt out of targeted ads and renew your Ad ID on iOS

# Summary #
Advertisers need to uniquely identify you across apps and websites in order to aggregate data they might collect about you from each source. To do so, Apple issues an Ad ID for your device, which it then shares with advertisers so they can serve you ads based on your data. In this guide you'll learn how to avoid such targeted advertisement either by periodically resetting your Ad ID or by opting out completely.

> **Warning**: If you are using iOS 14+, targeted advertisements are opt-in by default.

### Opt out of targeted advertising ###
[We have written before][1] about the risks that targeted advertisements pose in regards to your digital privacy.

To opt out of targeted ads based on location, open the **Settings** app and go to **Privacy > Location Services > System Services** and turn off **Location-Based Apple Ads** (Fig. 1).
