Opt out of targeted ads on Windows

# Summary #
Advertisers need to uniquely identify you across apps and websites in order to aggregate data they might collect about you from those sources. To do so, Microsoft issues an Ad ID for your device, which it then shares with advertisers so they can serve you ads based on your data. In this guide you'll learn how to opt-out of targeted ads on Windows.

### Opt out of targeted ads ###

[We have written before][1] about the risks that targeted advertisements pose in regards to your digital privacy. To opt out of targeted ads on Windows, open the **Start** menu, go to **Settings > Privacy > General**, and disable **all** options (Fig. 1).

### Disable ads on lock screen ###

By default, Windows 10 displays ads on your lock screen. To prevent this behaviour, go to **Settings > Personalization > Lock screen > Background** and choose **Picture** or **Slideshow** (Fig. 4).
