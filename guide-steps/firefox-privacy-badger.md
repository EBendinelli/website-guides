Install an ad-blocker on Firefox - Privacy Badger

# Summary #
In this guide, you'll learn how to install Privacy Badger on Firefox, a browser add-on devcelopped by the Electronic Frontier Foundation to block malicious ads and trackers.

# Body #
Privacy Badger is a browser add-on to block ads and trackers from tracking you. It keeps an up-to-date list of known trackers that it finds through automated tests, and regularly pushes the updated list to your browser. As such, it works well alongside uBlock Origin, which keeps a manually curated list on malicious services. Privacy Badger is a project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and has a strong [privacy policy][1].

### Installation ###
Like any other add-on, install Privacy Badger by visiting the [Mozilla Firefox Add-ons page][2] and clicking **Add to Firefox** (Fig. 1) and then clicking on **Add** when prompted (Fig. 2).

Upon successful installation, a notification appears on the top-right corner and the Privacy Badger icon is added to your toolbar (Fig. 3). 

When you visit a website, Privacy Badger automatically blocks malicious trackers and ads, and sets a privacy protection level (green, yellow, or red) which you can manually adjust by clicking the toolbar icon (Fig. 4). To learn more about how Privacy Badger works, click the icon and then click **Learn how Privacy Badger protects your privacy** (Fig. 5), or visit its [official documentation][3]
