### Tracking prevention ###
Edge includes a basic tracking protection mechanism that you can enable to prevent trackers from collecting data about
you. Go to the **Tracking prevention** pane, and select **Balanced** protection (Fig. 2).

### Privacy ###

When browsing the web, your browser may warn websites that you do not want to be tracked. Beware that not all websites
respect this! For safer protection, please see [our guide on installing an ad-blocker](edge-ublock-origin.md). Still,
it's better to have this option turned on. Go to the **Privacy** pane and enable **Send "Do Not Track" requests** (Fig.
3).

### Sharing diagnostic data ###
The Edge browser collects diagnostics data to improve its service, but it also sells it to advertisers and trackers. To
prevent this, go to the **Optional diagnostic data** pane, and disable **Help improve Microsoft products by sending
optional diagnostics data about how you use the browser, websites you visit, and crash reports** (Fig. 4). from online
trackers.

### Personalized web experience ###
To prevent Microsoft from serving you ads based on your web browsing habits, go to the **Personalize your web
experience** pane and disable **Improve your web experience by allowing Microsoft to use your browsing history from this
account for personalizing advertising, search, news and other Microsoft services** (Fig. 5).

### Services ###

Microsoft Edge uses web services to improve your browsing experience. To do so, it may share your personal data with
Microsoft. To prevent this, go to the **Services** pane, and disable all options (Fig. 6). Then, click on **Address bar
and search** and disable both options (Fig. 7).
